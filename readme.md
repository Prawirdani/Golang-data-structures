## Data Structures Golang
Implementing **Stack** and **Queue** data structures with Golang, both are using Node, not a List or an Array. 
Available operations:
 - Stack: Push and Pop
 - Queue: Enqueue and Dequeue

You can add other operations for these two data structures like Peek or IsEmpty, feel free to play aroundâœŒ.
